          <p>
            I am a nice guy who likes the good things in life: a lovely family, 
            a nice place to live and a good job. I also like to involve in the
            community whenever time allows it. I was raised with good values 
            and I guide my life with the principles of spirituality, hard work,
            and kindness towards people and animals too.</p>
          <p>
            By the way, I'm passionate about web technologies, and I always
            try to improve that which I'm told to.
